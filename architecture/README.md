# Architecture Recipes

Strategic architecture patterns, governance playbooks, and decision frameworks for MuleSoft integration platforms. These recipes go beyond "how to configure" into "when, why, and what trade-offs."

## Recipes

| # | Recipe | Summary |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | [API-Led Anti-Patterns](api-led-anti-patterns/) | When 3-tier API-led is overkill and how to simplify |
| 2 | [C4E Setup Playbook](c4e-setup-playbook/) | Center for Enablement team structure, KPIs, and governance |
| 3 | [Event-Driven Architecture](event-driven-architecture-mulesoft/) | Anypoint MQ, VM queues, CDC, and when events beat request-reply |
| 4 | [Domain-Driven API Design](domain-driven-api-design/) | Map bounded contexts to API boundaries |
| 5 | [Multi-Region DR Strategy](multi-region-dr-strategy/) | Active-Active vs Active-Passive failover with RTO/RPO targets |
| 6 | [Application Network Topology](application-network-topology/) | Map your API catalog as a network graph, find bottlenecks |
| 7 | [Microservices vs API-Led](microservices-vs-api-led/) | When to use each, hybrid patterns, and the microservices tax |
| 8 | [Integration Maturity Model](integration-maturity-model/) | Level 1 (point-to-point) through Level 5 (composable enterprise) |

## How to Use These Recipes

Each recipe follows a consistent structure:

- **When to Use** — situational triggers and preconditions
- **Configuration / Code** — diagrams, decision trees, XML, real guidance
- **How It Works** — step-by-step walkthrough
- **Gotchas** — common mistakes and misunderstandings
- **Related** — cross-references to other recipes
