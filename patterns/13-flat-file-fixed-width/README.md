# 13 — Flat File & Fixed-Width

Patterns for parsing and generating fixed-width (positional) flat files — common in banking, insurance, COBOL systems, and government data interchange.

| Pattern | File | Difficulty | Description |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed-Width Parse | [fixed-width-parse.dwl](fixed-width-parse.dwl) | Intermediate | Parse positional flat files into structured data |
| Fixed-Width Generate | [fixed-width-generate.dwl](fixed-width-generate.dwl) | Intermediate | Generate fixed-width output with padding and alignment |
| Multi-Record Flat File | [multi-record-flatfile.dwl](multi-record-flatfile.dwl) | Advanced | Parse header/detail/trailer record types from one file |
| Flat File to JSON | [flatfile-to-json.dwl](flatfile-to-json.dwl) | Intermediate | Transform legacy flat files to modern JSON structures |
